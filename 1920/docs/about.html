    Hi there, I am Jordy! I'm a third year Computing Science student who's interested in anything programming related. Due to this interest I am always trying to learn more things and gain new experiences. My favourite study is of course Computing Science and my favourite <s>student</s> study association is Thalia. In my free time I like to play some games or have fun with friends; I sometimes also participate in game jams, where I make small games in Unity using C#, to hone my programming skills. I know how to work with tools like GitHub and I am familiar with Scrum and Agile.
